    "- Agent: Can make autonomous decisions about when and how to delegate tasks\n",
    "- The handoffs parameter enables the agent to autonomously decide whether to use tools or delegate to another agent. This gives the agent the ability to make dynamic decisions about task execution, which is the core difference between a workflow (deterministic) and an agent (autonomous).\n",
    "- The handoff capability allows the Sales Manager to decide whether to handle a task itself using tools or delegate it to the Email Manager agent, making the system truly agentic rather than just a predefined workflow."
